## Overview

CampusMart solves a real problem: students at the end of every semester are left with textbooks, lab equipment, hostel furniture, and electronics they no longer need — while the next batch desperately needs the same items. Instead of letting these go to waste, CampusMart enables a **closed-loop peer-to-peer economy** within a single campus.

**What makes it different:**
- 🔒 **College-scoped feeds** — you only see items sold by students at your own college
- 🤖 **AI verification** — Gemini 1.5 Flash automatically checks if a product's photo matches the seller's claimed condition
- 💬 **Real-time messaging** — Socket.IO-powered chat between buyer and seller, directly on the platform
- 💳 **Integrated payments** — Razorpay for QR/UPI-on-delivery flow
- 📦 **Rental support** — items can be listed for day/week/month rental, not just sale
- 📢 **Community Requests** — buyers post what they need, sellers respond with matching listings

## Features & Workflows

### Authentication & College Isolation

CampusMart uses **NextAuth v5** with a custom Credentials provider:

1. **Registration** (`/register`):
   - User provides name, email, college (from a curated approved list), and password
   - Password is hashed with **bcryptjs** before being stored
   - Each email must be unique across the platform

2. **Login** (`/login`):
   - Edge-safe config in `lib/auth.config.ts` for middleware usage
   - Full DB + bcrypt validation in `lib/auth.ts` (Node.js only)
   - On success, a **JWT session** is issued (30-day expiry)
   - Session stores: `id`, `email`, `name`, `college`, `isVerified`

3. **College Isolation**:
   - When fetching products on the home page, the query filters by the logged-in user's `college` field
   - Additionally, the legacy `sellerDomain` (derived from email's domain, e.g., `iitb.ac.in`) is matched for backward compatibility
   - Logged-out users see an **all-campus browse mode**

4. **Route Protection** (via `middleware.ts`):
   - `/dashboard/*` requires a valid session, otherwise redirects to `/login`
   - Authenticated users trying to visit `/login` or `/register` are redirected to `/`

---

### Product Listings (Buy & Sell)

**Workflow:**
1. Seller completes KYC (Seller Verification — see Admin Panel section)
2. Seller navigates to `/seller/add-product`
3. Fills out: title, category, description, condition (*new / good / used*), expected price, original price (optional), urgency flag, bundle flag
4. Uploads a photo → stored on **Cloudinary**
5. Photo is sent to **Gemini AI** to verify the condition automatically (`/api/ai/condition`)
6. Listing appears on the home page, filtered to college peers

**Product Features:**
- `isUrgent` flag — surfaces listings higher in home feed sort
- `isBundle` — groups multiple items under a `bundleTitle`
- `aiCondition` — stores AI-detected condition, mismatch flag, and failure flag
- Compound MongoDB index on `sellerDomain + createdAt` for efficient college-scoped queries
- **Status lifecycle:** `active → draft → sold`

**Product Detail Page** (`/product/[id]`):
- Displays price with discount % badge if `originalPrice` is provided
- Shows AI condition verification badge (✅ Verified / ⚠️ Mismatch / ℹ️ Unverified)
- Includes the **Fair Price Checker** component
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Related products section (same category)
- Seller profile snippet (name, email, campus badge)
- Sold-out overlay for inactive listings
- Rental pricing breakdown (day/week/month) if product is a rent item

---

### Rental Marketplace

Items can be listed for **rent** separately from sale:

1. Seller goes to `/seller/rent` and fills a rental form
2. Fields: title, description, category, condition, pricing (per day, optional: per week/month), availability window (from → till), security deposit, negotiation flag
3. Photo uploaded to **Cloudinary**, AI condition check runs
4. Rental items share the same product detail page template — differentiated by `__type: 'rent'`

**Rental-specific model fields (RentItem):**
- `pricing.day` (required), `pricing.week`, `pricing.month` (optional)
- `availability.from` and `availability.till` date range
- `securityDeposit` (optional, shown on product page)
- `allowNegotiation` flag
- **Status lifecycle:** `active → rented → unavailable`

---

### Community Requests

The **Requests** module (`/requests`) allows any student to post what they're looking for, so sellers can respond proactively:

**Workflow:**
1. **Buyer posts a request** at `/requests/new`:
   - Fields: item title, category, budget, preferred condition (New/Good/Used), optional description
   - Request is saved with `status: "open"` and linked to the buyer's user ID

2. **Sellers browse requests** at `/requests`:
   - Grid of open requests with category badges, budget, condition, and poster name
   - "Fulfill" button opens a modal with the seller's active listings
   - Seller selects a listing → a `RequestResponse` is created linking the request to the product

3. **Buyer accepts an offer** at `/requests/[id]`:
   - Buyer sees all seller offers with product thumbnails and prices
   - Clicking "Accept Offer" marks the response as `accepted`, changes request status to `fulfilled`, and redirects to the product page

4. **Status flow:** `open → fulfilled` (or `closed` for manual cancellation)

---

### Shopping Cart & Checkout

1. From any product page, buyer clicks "Add to Cart" (via `ProductActions` client component)
2. Cart is stored in MongoDB per user (`Cart` model)
3. `/cart` page shows all cart items with images, titles, and prices
4. Checkout initiates order creation (`/api/cart/checkout`):
   - Creates an `Order` record per cart item
   - Clears the cart
   - Initial status: `pending`

---

### Real-Time Chat (Socket.IO)

CampusMart runs a **custom Node.js HTTP server** (`server.js`) that wraps Next.js and attaches a **Socket.IO** server to the same port:

**Conversation lifecycle:**
1. Buyer clicks "Message Seller" on a product page
2. A `Conversation` document is created or fetched (unique per buyer+seller+item triple)
3. Buyer is redirected to `/chat/[conversationId]`

**Real-time flow:**
- Client emits `join_conversation` → server joins the socket to the room, resets unread count
- Client emits `send_message` → server saves the `Message` to MongoDB, increments unread count for the other participant, and broadcasts `receive_message` to the room
- Unread badge in the header (`UnreadBadge` component) polls `/api/conversation/unread` for the total count

**Chat features:**
- Inline offer cards — sellers can send a formal price offer from within chat (`/api/chat/offer`)
- Persistent message history loaded on page mount
- Real-time delivery without polling after the initial load

---

### Seller Dashboard

Accessible at `/dashboard` (requires active session + approved seller status):

**Sections:**
| Section | Description |
|---|---|
| **Overview Cards** | Total active listings, total sales revenue, pending orders, chat unread count |
| **Market Analysis** | Recharts bar/line graphs showing listing price distribution, category breakdown, and "Other listings range" comparisons |
| **My Products** | Table of all active/draft listings with quick edit and delete actions |
| **My Rent Items** | Separate table for rental listings with availability and status management |
| **Orders** | `/seller/orders` — incoming orders with buyer info, payment method, and status controls |
| **Earnings** | `/seller/earnings` — revenue breakdown by product, order timeline |
| **Settings** | `/seller/settings` — personal info, payment details, notification preferences |

**Seller onboarding (`/seller/register`):**
- Multi-section form: personal details → college details (course, department, year, roll number) → payment details (bank account + UPI ID)
- Student ID card uploaded to Cloudinary
- Creates a `SellerRequest` with `status: "pending"` awaiting admin approval

---

### Admin Panel

Accessible at `/dashboard/admin` (restricted to admin accounts):

**Sub-pages:**
| Page | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** | `/dashboard/admin` | Platform-wide statistics |
| **Analytics** | `/dashboard/admin/analytics` | Revenue charts, category breakdowns, active user counts |
| **Seller Verification** | `/dashboard/admin/seller-verification` | Review pending seller applications; view ID cards, bank details; Approve / Reject with a single click |
| **Active Sellers** | `/dashboard/admin/active-sellers` | List of all approved sellers with ability to disable accounts |
| **Settings** | `/dashboard/admin/settings` | Platform configuration flags |

**Admin API routes:**
- `GET /api/admin/stats` — aggregated platform stats
- `GET/POST /api/admin/verification` — list and review seller applications
- `PATCH /api/admin/verification/[id]` — approve or reject a seller
- `GET /api/admin/sellers` — all approved sellers
- `PATCH /api/admin/sellers/[id]` — disable a seller account

---

### AI Condition Verification

**How it works:**

1. When a seller uploads a product image, the frontend calls `POST /api/ai/condition` with the image URL and the seller's claimed condition
2. The API uses **@google/generative-ai** to call **Gemini 1.5 Flash** with the image
3. Gemini returns its assessment of the item's condition (e.g., "good", "used", "new-like")
4. The API compares the AI-detected condition with the seller's claimed condition
5. If there's a mismatch, `mismatch: true` is stored; if Gemini fails, `aiFailed: true` is stored
6. This is saved in the product's `aiCondition` subdocument

**Display on product pages:**
- ✅ `text-emerald-400` — "Condition verified by AI"
- ⚠️ `text-amber-400` — "Condition may differ from listing" + shows both conditions
- ℹ️ `text-slate-400` — "Condition not verified" (AI failed)

---

### Fair Price Checker

The `FairPriceChecker` component appears on both:
- **Product detail pages** (buyer mode) — tells buyers if the price is fair compared to similar listings
- **Seller add-product form** (seller mode) — advises sellers on competitive pricing

**How it works:**
1. Component calls `POST /api/products/similar` with: title, category, condition, price, excludeId
2. The API finds similar products (same category + fuzzy title match) from the DB
3. Returns stats: `avgPrice`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `recommendedRange`, `priceDifferencePercent`, `recommendation`
4. Component color-codes the result:
   - 🟢 Green — price is below market average (good deal)
   - 🟡 Amber — within 10% of market (fair)
   - 🔴 Red — more than 10% above market (consider reducing)

---

### Razorpay Payments

CampusMart uses a **"COD → UPI on delivery"** hybrid flow:

1. Buyer places order with `paymentMethod: "cod"`
2. When the seller goes to deliver, they generate a **Razorpay Payment Link** via the orders dashboard
3. A QR code / link is generated for the buyer to pay via UPI on the spot
4. Razorpay sends a **webhook** to `/api/webhook` on successful payment
5. The webhook updates the order: `status: "paid"`, stores `razorpayPaymentId`

**Order Status Flow:**
```
pending → out_for_delivery → paid → completed
          └──────── cancelled (terminal) ──────┘
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18
- npm ≥ 9
- A MongoDB Atlas account (free tier works)
- A Cloudinary account (free tier works)
- A Google AI Studio account (Gemini API key)
- A Razorpay account (for payments)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/CampusMart.git
cd CampusMart

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials (see Environment Variables section)

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** `npm run dev` starts the **custom `server.js`** (not `next dev`) to enable Socket.IO support on the same port.

### Available Scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dev` | `node server.js` | Development server with Socket.IO (hot reload) |
| `build` | `next build` | Production build (Turbopack) |
| `start` | `next start` | Start production Next.js server |
| `lint` | `eslint` | Run ESLint across the project |

### First-Time Setup
1. Register an account at `http://localhost:3000/register`
2. To create an admin account, manually set a user's `isVerified: true` in MongoDB and add an admin flag (or use the first registered account as admin in your dev environment)
3. Apply for seller access at `/seller/register`
4. Approve your own seller application via `/dashboard/admin/seller-verification`
5. Add your first product listing at `/seller/add-product`

---

## Deployment Notes

- The custom `server.js` is **required** for Socket.IO to work — standard Next.js serverless deployment (Vercel) will **not** support the WebSocket connection
- Deploy to a **VPS / container** (e.g., AWS EC2, Railway, Render, DigitalOcean Droplet) where a persistent Node.js process can run
- Set all environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard
- MongoDB Atlas allows-listing: whitelist your server's IP (or use `0.0.0.0/0` for dev)
- Cloudinary free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB monthly bandwidth — sufficient for initial scale
- Razorpay webhooks: configure the webhook URL to `https://your-domain.com/api/webhook`
